LinkedIn Funnel to get warm leads 👇🏻

1. Create sales assets

📍Build a list of 10-20 of your favorite creators.

This list should include:

General top high-performing LinkedIn creators

3-5 people who have the same niche as yours & their posts perform well

📍Use Kleo to find their viral posts by filtering their top posts by comments 

📍Take them as a reference and use Gamma AI to make the sales assets for you

2. Create a LinkedIn post 

📍 Breakdown your sales assets and make a LinkedIn lead magnet.

📍Checklist for the Lead Magnet’s LinkedIn post:

✅ Make sure you are repurposing a viral post Hook

✅ Have a Social Proof on how this worked in past

✅ Have an Urgent CTA

✅ Ask people to comment to get the sales asset

3. Scrape the comments 

We use PhantomBuster  to scrape the warms leads we have gotten through the lead magnet.

4. Enrich the list

You can use Persana AI to get their company details like:

- email
