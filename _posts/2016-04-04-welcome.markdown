For two years I wanted to write but was figuring out what and how. I think the impossible task was not to figure out, but to sit down and start writing.

Finally, I make my mind and start finishing the stuff which I always wanted to finish. I have tidbits kept in here, which soon will be blogged.

Its not really for anyone but for myself to keep me notes and help me see the progress.

I have done a lot of migration on this blog. From wordpress to octopress to pelican then back to octopress. I think I will stay here with you. Octopress!!

well and its just the beginning, I am glad I do not have a lots of posts to migrate.

Others may soon follow.
