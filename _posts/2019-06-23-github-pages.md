# What is Github
Github is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control using git which is quite similar to SVN and Mercurial. Github allows us to work with other developers together on the projects. You can sign up for github at https://github.com

![Github_account](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/img_github_account.jpg)

Essential components of Github are:
1. Repositories
2. Branches
3. Commits
4. Pull Request
5. [Git] (The version control software Github is built on.)

To learn more about git do visit the [git-scm] page.

## What is Github pages.

> GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository.

Basically with Github pages you can host your static HTML site, like your portfolio, your blog on an information site, which do not require a lot of content-changes very frequently.

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service and doesn't support server-side code such as, PHP, Ruby, or Python.

Ruby and Python can be used to generate static site though which can then be pushed into your repositries.

They are also not intended for or allowed to be used as a free web hosting service
GitHub Pages sites are subject to the following usage limits:

GitHub Pages source repositories have a recommended limit of 1GB .

Published GitHub Pages sites may be no larger than 1 GB.

GitHub Pages sites have a soft bandwidth limit of 100GB per month.

GitHub Pages sites have a soft limit of to run our online businesses, e-commerce sites, or any other website that is primarily directed at either facilitating commercial transactions or providing commercial software as a service (SaaS).

### Limitations

GH Pages sites are subject to the following usage limits:

* The source repositories hosting your blog have a recommended limit of 1GB .
* Published sites cannot be no larger than 1 GB.
* The sites will have a soft bandwidth limit of 100GB per month.
* And your site will only be build for 10 times in an hour, if you are using jekyll or pelican as static site generator.

While you have hosted your content on the github pages. Please also make sure you follow these guidelines and must refrain from:
* Content or activity that is illegal or otherwise prohibited by our Terms of Service or Community Guidelines
* Violent or threatening content or activity
* Excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming)
* Activity that compromises GitHub users or GitHub services
* Get-rich-quick schemes
* Sexually obscene content
* Content that misrepresents your identity or site purpose

## Why Github Pages
Gtihub pages uses static sites techincally, a static website is only HTML and CSS and doesn't involve scripting. To change the content which appears source code needs to be edited directly. In simple words, the content of the website will remain same for every visit whereas for dynamic sites the content will keep on changing. For e.g. the news feed of facebook is a dynamic site, but book review site can be a static site, since the content remains constant for somtime.  There are many reasons which makes a static site desirable than a dynamic site as follows:

1. Security
Static websites are a safe bet compared to dynamic ones when it comes to security as they donât rely on CMS plugins. APIs and JavaScript are used to handle the dynamic functions of static websites, eliminating the risk of getting hacked. On the other hand, active websites are highly prone to get hacked due to multiple content sources and plugins.

A report by WP WhiteSecurity states that about 70% of WordPress sites are at risk of getting hacked by malicious hackers because of lack of maintenance and upgrading. Ugh, scary.

2. Reliability
You must have occasionally come across an error message saying that, "The connection could not be established.â This primarily occurs because of the database errors. Serving just basic HTML files makes it easier to host them anywhere with ease like on a CDN.
Hence, whenever thereâd be an attack on the server, the static website is just rredirected to other closest node, unlike its dynami
